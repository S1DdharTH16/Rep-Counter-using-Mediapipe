# Rep-Counter-using-Mediapipe
 
Description:
Developed a real-time rep counter web application using Mediapipe computer vision library and Flask framework. The application utilizes pose estimation to track joint movements and calculate angles for exercises such as push-ups, squats, and lunges. The rep count is displayed on the screen in real-time, along with the option to select different exercises. Integrated exercise demonstration videos and provided an interactive user interface for an enhanced workout experience.

This description highlights the key technologies used (Mediapipe and Flask), the main functionalities of the project (real-time rep counting, exercise selection, and demonstration videos), and the value it brings to users (enhanced workout experience).
